        <div>
          I'm Jatin, 23 year old self taught fullstack web developer with more
          than 3 years of experience. I specialize in building websites with
          user-friendly frontend and well optimized backend using React.js and
          Node.js.

        <div>
          I'm also a part of a Work Integrated learning program with HCL Tech.
          As experienced software engineer my role includes web application
          development, job automation, and performance optimization using
          technologies like React.js, Redwood, and ISIS Papyrus.

          When I'm not working, I love kicking back and getting into web series
          and anime. Gaming is also a big part of my downtime â€“ there's nothing
          like diving into a good game. And to balance it all out, I enjoy
          staying active with workouts and playing sports like football. This
          helps me keep my head clear while I am working.
